KerKerInput(IMF) Readme
==================================
The new KerKerInput is now a input method framework on the existing Android IMF.
Its goal is to provide common used components such as Virtual Keyboard, Physical
KB <=> Virtual KB keycode conversion, candidates mechanism and most importantly
the .cin file support.

I hope this framework could be a starter kit or used as a starting point to
develop your own Android IME in (mostly Traditional) Chinese.

Current Status
==============
KerKerInput is currently working on the Android version 1.5 and after.
Now we provide a few basic input method support and a fun barcode input method,
we also provided some basic demostration modules in the code to show you how
the modules mechanism working.

Documentation is planned. However, due to limited resources, I cannot focus
on this right now. If you would like to see KerKerInput being more actively
developed, please consider a donation. Don't worry, I will still working on this
project right now.

Current WIP
==============
Here are few things I am working on right now:
  - Documentation
  - Common .cin based input module
  - Cleanup dirty codes
  - Make barcode recognition works better
  
You're welcomed to contribute your patch/code by using the github or
email me the patch alone with your contact information for the credit. :)
  
Known Issues
=============
  - Some interaction during switching IME or re-open the IME on another textbox
    is not very smooth.
  - Camera only works on HTC phones for now. Need document for raw camera source
    data for phones from other manufactures. 
  - ... (a lot of bugs here.)

License
=============
 The full code sweep for licensing issues is being working on, but all the framework
 parts are written by me, and will be using MIT license.
